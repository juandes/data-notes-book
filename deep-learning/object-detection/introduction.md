# Introduction

Due to the amount of progress and research that have to be done in the recent years, the topic of object detection, which originally was considered as part of the computer vision field, have become closely connected to deep learning. The main reason behind this shifting is named convolutional neural networks. This network, which is typically used for image classification, is now being experimented in the area of object detection.

Over the next couple of pages, I will present the notes, tidbits and learnings I have gained during the time I have spent working with object detection.
