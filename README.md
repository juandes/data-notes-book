# Introduction

Hi :\)

Throughout this last couple of years, I have been gathering and compiling a bunch of information regarding machine learning, and different aspects of data science in general. Said compilation was getting a bit messy and unorganised and it needed a bit of attention to make it more comfortable and easier to use it. While doing this work, I thought what a great idea would be to share my notes and comments with the world.

This book is about those notes. My motivation with this guide is to collect all these notes in one place while adding extra information such as examples, code snippets and notes. However, I would like to mention that this is not an extensive or exhaustive guide to everything data or machine learning. This work is merely a collection of annotations about different topics I have struggled with or focused on during my professional life. Nonetheless, if I feel like there is a gap between some of the subjects, or if there is some essential element missing, I will write about it so that you, the reader, will be able to understand my line of thoughtfully.

Please note that this is a work in progress. I will be updating this guide one step at a time.

Thanks for being here, and I hope this guide will be useful. If there is any comment, issue or you would like to say hi, feel free to leave me a message.
